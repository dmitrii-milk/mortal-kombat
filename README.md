Check on which port the utility was launched, if the port is [http://localhost:3000] continue on. <br/>
Otherwise, copy the resulting port from the _Resources_ line in the terminal and replace it in the _action.js_ file.<br/>
3. Run the **npm start** command.<br/>
4. Enjoy<br/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br/>
**Redux** was used to store the state of the components<br/>
